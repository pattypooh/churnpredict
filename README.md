# churnpredict
Classification use case

The aim of this project is to predict whether customers will continue to use the bank's services or whether they will close their account (churn).

In the frame of the course in machinelearnia, this project implements a predictive model capable of determining, for each costumer, whether they churn or not.  

This is a private competition hosted in Kaggle, only for enrolled students in machinelearnia course.
